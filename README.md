# MapApp

In this app [Google map api](https://developers.google.com/maps/) and [react-native-maps](https://github.com/react-community/react-native-maps) were used to showcase usecases for react-native-maps.

For DataSource I used [CityBike NYC](https://feeds.citibikenyc.com/stations/stations.json) live feed to get the city bike locations in NYC. Of course any data source with location information can be used.
